# Twitter oEmbed support apparently extended

The new version of **Twitter API 1.1** wrongly requires OAuth for [oEmbed part of API][1]. I found the discussion of this problem in trac and one very [encouraging response][2] from Andrew Nacin:

> [Andrew Nacin][3]: Initial response from Twitter is that &#8220;the endpoint will continue to operate unauthenticated, as-is the spirit of oEmbed.&#8221; Still trying to confirm whether that means 1.0&#8217;s oEmbed endpoint will remain in operation past the 1.0 shutdown, if 1.1&#8217;s oEmbed endpoint will be changed to be entirely unauthenticated, or both. Either way, we&#8217;re in the clear in terms of not needing to implement something new. <p </p>
