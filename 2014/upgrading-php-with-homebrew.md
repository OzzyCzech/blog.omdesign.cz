# Upgrading PHP with Homebrew

Are you using [josegonzalez brew repository][1] according my [previous blog post][2]? You will need switch your brew to an [official PHP repository][3].

    brew untap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew tap homebrew/versions
    brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php

Then you can exec upgrade everything:

    brew update && brew upgrade

Do not forgot change your shortcut in your [bash profile][4]:

    alias php-start="sudo launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist"
    alias php-stop="sudo launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist"
    alias php-restart="php-stop && php-start"

You can also getting an error **Dubious ownership on file&#8230;** then change *._plists_ rights:

    sudo chown root ~/Library/LaunchAgents/*
    sudo chmod 644 ~/Library/LaunchAgents/*<p</p>
