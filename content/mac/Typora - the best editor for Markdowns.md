# Typora - the best editor for Markdowns

I am just found the best (*for me*) Markdown editor on the planet. Why?

- it's freeware and opensource
- it's minimalistic and easy to use
- combine wysiwyg and plaintext editing 
- support folders, [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), custom styles, 
- allow quick file open ‚åò + ‚áß + O üòç

You can download and install it with [brew](https://brew.sh/index_cs):

```shell
brew cask install typora
```
