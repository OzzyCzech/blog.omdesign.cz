Perfect balance between sound and size. Fully waterproof, and plays louder then JBL Charge2+.
Considerable bass punch for its size and price and [better sound quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZMk76VOGkk) then
much larger JBL Xtreme.

## [Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Wireless](http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Wireless-Speakers/Wireless-Speakers/Zeppelin-Wireless/product-details.html)
