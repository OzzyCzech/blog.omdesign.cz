# Best wireless speakers of 2016

It wasn't easy to choose, there is many and many of bluetooth/wireless speakers.
There is my personal list: 

## [Harman/Kardon Go+Play 2016](http://www.harmankardon.com/bluetooth-speakers/HK+GO+PLAY.html)

Harman Kardon Go + Play doesn't have loads of extra features but there is a
pair of 1-inch angled tweeters and, in the middle, a great big circular passive radiator!
It's a **room-filler** with nice design and fancy handler. [Check out YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x8FPzHNKZ0)

## [Harman/Kardon Aura Plus](http://www.harmankardon.com/wireless-speakers/AURA.html)

With six high/mid-range trandsducers and a subwoofer delivering 360 degree sound.
It fills the room not only by its round design speakers but also works with the
custom stereo widening DSP engineered to bring you room-filling full frequency sound.
DLNA, WiFi, AirPlay, Bluetooth connectivity and nice [RedDot Award](http://red-dot-21.com/design/harman-kardon-aura-studio/) Winning Design

## [JBL Charge 3](http://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+CHARGE+III.html)

![JBL Charge 3 <](/img/2016/09/JBL-charge-3.jpg)
Perfect balance between sound and size. Fully waterproof, and plays louder then JBL Charge2+.
Considerable bass punch for its size and price and [better sound quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZMk76VOGkk) then
much larger JBL Xtreme.

## [Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Wireless](http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Wireless-Speakers/Wireless-Speakers/Zeppelin-Wireless/product-details.html)
